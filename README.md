# Maze Solver in Python (Tkinter)

This project is a maze solver built using Python 3 and Tkinter. The solver uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to solve randomly generated mazes, with a visual representation of the algorithm in action.

## Features

- Visualizes the DFS algorithm as it solves the maze.
- Mazes are randomly generated.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your machine.
2. Run `main.py` to start the maze solver with DFS visualization:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

3. A maze will be generated randomly, and DFS will be used to solve it.
4. Watch the algorithm solve the maze step by step.

## Testing

To run the unit tests for this project, use:

```bash
python3 tests.py
```
